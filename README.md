# TD-Ameritrade-API
These are some simple functions that can be useful in getting to learn how to use the TD Ameritrade API.  

I have not included any functions that are capable of actually buying or selling securities.

I do not advise using code that you have not written yourself to either buy or sell securities algorithmically.

I also advise practicing by altering or enhancing the functions given in this file and/or writing similar ones yourself before attempting to write code to place orders.
